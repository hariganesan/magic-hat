Notes
=======

- start working on paper

- work on opening lead
- make a preferred suit (heirarchy?)
- bidHistory - each bid should also be:
	- strong vs weak
	- artificial or cue bids (michaels, gerber, blackwood, etc.)
	- transfers
- making constants for each location, where to put?

- roles
- make default choices for hands

- AI
	- if partner is winning, then duck?
	- you could duck if your card is higher than partners (10 vs J)
	- if opponent is out of suit (no trumps) then keep playing it

- order test situations
- making constant
- what is the next card?
- what is the next bid?
- print statements for each card, then do a diff
