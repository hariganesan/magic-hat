=======

- setting up new render file
	- how to split up rendering? look up
- making constants for each location, where to put?


- making use for testing
	- role, hand, bid

- make default choices for hands

- AI
	- if partner is winning, then duck?
	- you could duck if your card is higher than partners (10 vs J)
	- if opponent is out of suit (no trumps) then keep playing it
