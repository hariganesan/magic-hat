Trump suits

Playing as the declarer
- play out opponent trumps
- look for finesse opportunities
- look for possible ruffs in short suits
- look for a long non-trump suit
- manage your entries


Playing as the defender
- any bid suits/elimate opponent bid suits (except cue bids)?
- opening lead?
	- Notrump: fourth highest card of longest suit
