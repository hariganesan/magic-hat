<h2>The use of AI in teaching: Bridge and other trick-taking card games</h2>
<h3>Hari Ganesan <br />
Advised by Dana Angluin</h3>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p> This project is an application that serves as both a tutorial for someone learning how to play Bridge as well as an interface for someone to play Bridge with three AI players. The application is created in the style of a video game and its structure is highly reflective of this style. The game is created with SDL and OpenGL, and uses JSON to store lesson data. The main feature of the game is the AI that calculates decisions within the play of the hand in order to try and make a specified contract or to try and defend against a contract. This contract can be selected beforehand, and all bids are stored in a bid history. The application also introduces lessons and scenarios. A lesson includes several slides to represent various sections of the tutorial. A scenario is a representation of a point in time in the play of a Bridge hand which holds the information of the bid as well as all of the cards left in playersâ€™ hands. Also included in the game is functionality to include new lessons and create new scenarios. The executable has two flags as command-line arguments that deal with scenarios: one is to test a specified scenario, and the other is to output a random scenario. The game also serves as a boilerplate for other trick-taking card games, which could reuse many of the same structural and graphical aspects. Future considerations include bidding systems, scenario analysis, advanced graphics, a user interface for navigating through multiple lessons, and other trick-taking card games. </p>
